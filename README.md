## Customization

### Before Installation

Edit `custom-preset.conf` to enable/disable components:
- SDDM login manager
- Bluetooth
- GTK themes
- zsh with Oh-My-Zsh
- And more...

### After Installation

All configs are in `~/.config/`. Main files to edit:
- `~/.config/hypr/` - Hyprland configuration
- `~/.config/quickshell/bar/` - Custom bar configuration
- `~/.config/foot/` - Terminal configuration
- `~/.zshrc` - Shell configuration

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Warning: You are using an autogenerated config"

This means the custom dotfiles weren't copied. Run the diagnostic:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/my_archinstaller
./diagnose.sh
```

The diagnostic will tell you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

### Quick Fix

If dotfiles weren't copied:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/my_archinstaller/Hyprland-Dots
./copy.sh
hyprctl dispatch exit  # Restart Hyprland
```

### Check Installation Logs

If something fails during installation:

```bash
ls ~/Documents/my_archinstaller/Install-Logs/
cat ~/Documents/my_archinstaller/Install-Logs/install-*.log
```

## Manual Installation (Without Preset)

If you want to select options manually:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Important:** Make sure to select:
- ✅ quickshell
- ✅ dots (Download and install pre-configured Hyprland dotfiles)
- ✅ sddm (if you want login manager)
- ✅ gtk_themes (for Dark/Light mode)
- ✅ bluetooth (if you need it)
- ✅ xdph (for screen sharing)

## Verification

After installation, verify everything was installed correctly:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/my_archinstaller
./verify-before-transfer.sh
```

## Notes

- The installation will backup existing configs to `~/.config/<app>.backup`
- Event-based monitoring reduces CPU usage significantly
- All scripts are logged to `Install-Logs/`
- First boot runs `initial-boot.sh` to set up themes and wallpapers
